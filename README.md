### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a back-end developer specializing in Ruby on Rails framework and AWS cloud infrastructure (using IaC with CDK and CloudFormation). But I have found that I love learning about Data Science and I am actively learning the necessary Python tools and areas of mathematics that help me achieve my goal of moving from backend development to Data Science.
