<p align="center">ðŸ‘‹ <b>Hi there</b>!</p>

I'm advancing my knowledge in **Machine Learning (Computer Vision)** as part of the capabilities of **Digital Twin** technology and its applications in the **Smart City** and **Industrial Metaverse** sectors.

With over **3 years of experience as a Full Stack Software Engineer on IoT project**, I have a strong background in building and managing complex systems using Ruby on Rails (backend), ReactJS (frontend), and AWS (cloud infrastructure)

I am actively seeking out learning materials, tools, and research papers to deepen my understanding of how predictive analytics can enhance Digital Twin development. I believe that integrating these advanced analytics will not only improve operational efficiency but also foster innovation in the realms of Smart Cities and the Industrial Metaverse.

*I like to take on new challenges and find creative solutions. My goal is to keep learning and help build amazing new technologies for the future*.
