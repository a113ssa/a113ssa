<p align="center">ðŸ‘‹ <b>Hi there</b>!</p>

I am a **Full-Stack developer** with over <b>3 years of Software Development</b> experience at <b>IoT project</b> excited about using **Digital Twin** to create a better future. This technology can help us predict and solve problems before they happen.

I am particularly interested in exploring the predictive capabilities of Digital Twins through **Data Science** and **Machine Learning**. 

I am actively seeking out learning materials, tools, and research papers to deepen my understanding of how predictive analytics can enhance Digital Twin development. I believe that integrating these advanced analytics will not only improve operational efficiency but also foster innovation in the realms of Smart Cities and the Industrial Metaverse.

*I like to take on new challenges and find creative solutions. My goal is to keep learning and help build amazing new technologies for the future*.
