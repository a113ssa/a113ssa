<p align="center">ðŸ‘‹ <b>Hi there</b>!</p>

I am a **Full-Stack developer** with over <b>3 years of Software Development</b> experience at <b>IoT project</b> excited about using Unreal Engine VR and Data Science to create a better future. These technologies can help us predict and solve problems before they happen. This can be very useful for Digital Twins, where we make a digital copy of something in the real world

I am learning more about **Unreal Engine 5** and focusing on **VR Blueprint and C++ development** and expanding my skills in **Data Science** and **Python** as well.

I like to take on new challenges and find creative solutions. My goal is to keep learning and help build amazing new technologies for the future.
