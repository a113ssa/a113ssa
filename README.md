<p align="center">👋 <b>Hi there</b>!</p>

I am a **Full-Stack developer** with over <b>3 years of Software Development</b> experience at <b>IoT project</b> excited about using **Digital Twin** to create a better future. This technology can help us predict and solve problems before they happen.

I am learning more about **OpenUSD/Omniverse**, **Unreal Engine 5** (C++/Blueprints), and expanding my skills in **Python**.

I like to take on new challenges and find creative solutions. My goal is to keep learning and help build amazing new technologies for the future.
